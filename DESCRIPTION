Description: Provides tools for numerically exploring the orthogonality of functions 
    by computing integrals of their products over specified intervals. Orthogonal 
    functions are fundamental in mathematical analysis, particularly in Fourier 
    analysis and function approximation. The package includes visualization and 
    summary methods for analyzing integration results. Based on the mathematical 
    definitions from "Fourier Series" by Georgi P. Tolstov.
